MSSQL Runner provides a way of running MSSQL script with a set of parameters for ETL usage

Installation
------------

MSSQL Runner requires Python 3.6+

::

    python3 -m venv <virtual env name>
    source <virtual env name>/bin/activate
    pip install mssql-runner

Quickstart
----------

There are three types of substitution parameters that can be used through mssql runner.  The first is a set of standard etl params for ease of use:

*  -f, from_date, default 1776-07-24
*  -t,to_date, default 9999-12-31
*  -b, batch_no, default is -1

The second option is for arbitrary variable expansion.  This is passed in the following format because rundeck commands don't like json quotes:

*  -p, example: -p "param1-val1, param2-val2"

The final option is to use the batchy integration

*  -wf, batchy_job, this will substitue parameters from a batchy workflow, this should be a fully qualified batchy job name of the format wf.job, if no job is specified it will assume global

Here is a sample SQL Script.  If run in SQL workbench you will be prompted for values for var1 and var2.

::

    drop table if exists  zzztemp;

    create table zzztemp (
    dt timestamp,
    var varchar,
    from_date timestamp,
    batch_no integer
    );

    insert into zzztemp
    values (getdate(), '$[?var1]', '$[?from_date]', '$[?batch_no]');

    insert into zzztemp
    values (getdate(), '$[?var2]', '$[?from_date]', '$[?batch_no]');

    select * from zzztemp;


In mssql runner you would use the following params to substitute that value.  It is assumed these params would be dynamically substituted by the calling script or informatica process:

``python -m mssql_runner.module -s "sample/mssql_runner_test.sql" -p "var1-cat, var2-dog" -b '9999'``

Assuming you had workflow config in batchy under wf3, you could also use this script:

``python -m  mssql_runner.module -s sample/mssql_runner_test.sql -wf wf3``


Development
-----------

Getting Started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is recommended to use the steps below to set up a virtual environment for development:

::

    python3 -m venv <virtual env name>
    source <virtual env name>/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Testing
~~~~~~~

::

    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

To run the testing suite, simply run the command: ``tox`` or ``python -m unittest discover tests``
